# NetMicroservices

This repo is part of the project I did when I was learning using microservices architecture in .NET. This repo will be enlarged again in  the future.

However, the point that can be useful here is that I tried to implement a clean architecture and code in this repository.

I am happy if it is useful for you.

Thanks for reviewing this. Star it if you like it ))
